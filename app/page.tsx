          Hi! I usually go by Sirius on the Internet, though my real name is
          Akshat. I'm an 18 year old AI researcher, entrepreneur, and developer
          deeply passionate about generative AI.
        </p>
        <p>
          My interests extend to robotics, hardware, blockchain, nuclear fusion,
          mixed reality, open-source, and open research.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm the founder and CEO of{" "}
          <a href="http://mithrilai.xyz/" target="_blank">
            Mithril AI
          </a>
          , an open-source AI R&D company dedicated to democratizing AI. Our
          goal is to be the 'Linux of AI' by making everything from model
          weights to data pipelines completely open and accessible to everyone.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also founded{" "}
          <a href="https://www.opendeeplearning.xyz/" target="_blank">
            OpenDeepLearning
          </a>
          , a nonprofit offering free AI education for all, and{" "}
          <a href="https://hack2tfuture.github.io/" target="_blank">

          , a club for hackers building cool projects together.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond tech, Iâ€™m into music, creating AI-gen tracks with my band,{" "}
          <a href="https://oneringband.netlify.app/" target="_blank">
            One Ring
          </a>
          , and I also enjoy reading books in different genres (explore my
          bookshelf on{" "}

        <p>Some things I believe:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Anyone can learn anything online and achieve their goals if they're
            truly passionate about it.

            </a>{" "}
            techno-optimist philosophy is the way forward. We should speed up
            technological progress, especially in developing AGI.
          </li>
          <li>
            Open source and open research are crucial. I believe AGI should be
            open source for everyone's benefit.
          </li>
          <li>AGI is more likely to help humans than harm them.</li>
          <li>
            We need more nuclear fusion plants for clean, sustainable energy.
            Fusion could meet our growing energy needs for building AGI.
          </li>
        </ul>
